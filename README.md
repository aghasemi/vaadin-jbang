# Vaadin + JBang
This is a minimal, single-file example of using [JBang](https://www.jbang.dev/) to develop a Vaadin 24 web application. The code was taken from [https://github.com/Artur-/vaadin24-embedded-jetty] and then modified, minimalised, and had it's essential dependencies extracted from the effective POM, so that we reach a single-file script that can be run with JBang. 

The application can be run simply via `jbang VaadinWebApp.java`.
